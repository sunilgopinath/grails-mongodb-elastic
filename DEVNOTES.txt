#### This is where I will keep track of creating the application #####

1. To create the stub grails framework I used netbeans create grails app
2. To add mongodb to grails and removed hibernate I used a tip from 
http://etcpe9.wordpress.com/2012/01/28/beginning-grails-2-0-with-mongodb/
INSTALLING MONGODB
 - I ran grails install-plugin mongodb but got an error saying I need to specify the version
 - Used the grails shell but then got an error about missing property
 - finally tried Grails plugins... that worked
REMOVING HIBERNATE
 - I ran grails uninstall-plugin hibernate from the "Run Grails Command" but to no avail
 - just removed runtime ":hibernate:$grailsVersion" from /grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy
3. To start creating domain classes and controllers I used Grails - A Quick Start Guide
4. Scaffolding does not seem to work with mongodb. I tried to create a textarea by default through constraints
but am unable to do so. Also I cannot change the order of the fields.
